    <h1>The Best Movies According to Syaman</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies all-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song</h3>
    <p>
      The best anime in terms of action, story, and most importantly the songs
      are a joy to listen to.
    </p>
    <h3>The Rising Of The Shield Hero: Season 1</h3>
    <p>The most epic plot that made me feel the main character in the story</p>
    <h3>All movies made by Makoto Shinkai</h3>
    <p>
      All his movies are made from the heart. All the movies are very emotional
      and also give a certain beauty to the movie. Also, all the music presented
      in the movie is very heartfelt.
