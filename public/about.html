    <p>
      Hello, my name is Muhammad Syaman, but you can call me Syaman. I aspire to
      become a full stack web developer. I have a fundamental understanding of
      both front-end and back-end development. However, my knowledge so far is
      limited to the basics. Therefore, I am starting from scratch to ensure I
      fully grasp web development and cover any gaps in my learning.
